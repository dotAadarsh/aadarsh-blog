### Introduction

Hi everyone! How about storing your memories and making them work after you die? Well, it's Sci-fi, right? We have seen these types of concepts in different movies and series. But let's come to real not reel. Let's move on...

Data society is advancing and creating towards the reevaluating of religious and philosophical originations that humankind has just made. The expression "soul" was utilized for recognizable proof of specific people in various pieces of our reality and various societies. Presently this issue is one of the most significant issues. There is an origination that human cognizance can be introduced in advanced structures. Now we don't have much chance to acknowledge it, however, science is growing quickly. Simply envision: such things were simply in sci-fi, however now we are ever nearer to making it genuine. How about we talk about it from a philosophical perspective?
  
### What exactly does Digital Immortality (or "virtual immortality") mean?

To be precise it is the theoretical idea of putting away (or moving) an individual's character in progressively solid media, i.e., a PC. The outcome may appear as though a symbol acting, responding, and taking on a similar mindset as an individual based on that individual's advanced chronicle. After the demise of the individual, this symbol could stay static or proceed to learn and grow independently.

### What about the practicality of the concept?

The  [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/)  has granted a half-million-dollar award to the colleges of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to investigate how scientists may utilize computerized reasoning, filing, and PC imaging to make persuading, advanced forms of genuine individuals, a potential initial move toward virtual everlasting status. The Digital Immortality Institute investigates three elements vital for advanced everlasting status. To begin with, at whatever degree of execution, symbols require ensured Internet availability. Next, symbols must be what clients indicate, and they should remain so. At long last, future portrayals must be made sure about before the living clients are no more. The point of  [Dmitry Itskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Itskov)'s  [2045 Initiative](http://2045.com/)  is to "make advances empowering the exchange of a person's character to a non-organic bearer, and expanding presence, including to the point of eternality"

### What are the methods to achieve this?

Archiving and digitizing people and making the avatar live are the two methods to achieve it. Let's take a close look at these two

**Achieving and digitalizing People  -** As indicated by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray from  [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), holding each discussion that an individual has ever heard is now reasonable: it needs not exactly a terabyte of capacity (for satisfactory quality). The discourse or text acknowledgment advances are probably the greatest test of the idea. A subsequent change is to document and break down social Internet use to plan the character of individuals. By breaking down social Internet use over 50 years, it is conceivable to show a general public's way of life, a general public's perspective, and a general public inclination.

Rothblatt imagines the production of "mind files" – assortments of information from a wide range of sources, including the photographs we transfer to Facebook, the conversations and suppositions we share on gatherings or sites, and other online networking cooperations that mirror our background and our novel self.

Richard Grandmorin[↗](https://twitter.com/soon_immortal) summed up the idea of advanced eternality by the accompanying condition: "semantic examination + social web use + Artificial Intelligence = everlasting status".

Some find that photographs, recordings, sound clips, web-based life posts, and other information about oneself could as of now be viewed as such a chronicling.

**Making the avatar alive** - Characterizing the symbol to be alive permits it to speak with the future as it keeps on learning, advancing, and associating with individuals if they despite everything exist. The activity exists to actualize a man-made reasoning framework for the avatar. This man-made consciousness framework is then accepted to think and will respond on the base of the file. Rothblatt proposes the expression "mindware" for programming that is being created to produce cognizant AIs. Such programming would peruse an individual's "mind file" to create a "mind clone." Rothblatt additionally proposes a specific degree of legislative endorsement for mindware, similar to an FDA affirmation, to guarantee that the subsequent mind clones are very much made.

Then the calibration process  - During the alignment procedure, the organic individuals are inhabiting a similar time as their curio in silicon. The ancient rarity in silicon is adjusted to be as close as conceivable to the individual being referred to. During this procedure progressing updates, synchronization, and collaboration between the two personalities would keep up the twin personalities as one.

### Outro

That's a huge process right, the main thing is we need internet connectivity much faster than what we use today - so what about the 5G Technology? Let's keep it for another.
