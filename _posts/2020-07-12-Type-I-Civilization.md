Welcome guys! The technology is rapidly increasing day by day. The scientist comes with a term for which the global civilization can be classified is called the [Kardashev Scale](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/1940897862948744641/4854779289886346916#). This measures the ability of a civilization to use all the energy available to it and it is scaled from 1 to 3. I hope this post will let you know about the Type I Civilization.

-   As indicated by mass-energy proportionality, Type I infers the change of around 2 kg of the issue to vitality every second. A proportional vitality discharge could hypothetically be accomplished by combining around 280 kg of hydrogen into helium every second, a rate generally comparable to 8.9×109 kg/year.

-   A cubic km of water contains around 1011 kg of hydrogen, and the Earth's seas contain about 1.3×109 cubic km of water, implying that people on Earth could support this pace of utilization over land time-scales, as far as accessible hydrogen. Antimatter in huge amounts would have a component to create power on a scale a few extents over the current degree of technology.

Currently, humanity doesn't even reach a type 1 civilization. This is because humans don't use all the forms of energy on earth. we use wood, coal, and oil. but there is a lot more. So what would change if humanity evolved into one of these types of civilizations? Being a type 1 civilization means we would have complete control over all the energy on earth. This means that we'd say goodbye to fossil fuels since they are limited and unsustainable. Instead, we could use the wind, sunlight, and water for our energy needs and since this energy is so accessible you may no longer need to pay your power bill. In a type 1 civilization, we'd continuously be using energy.

Hypothetically, people may, later on, have the capacity to develop and collect various normally happening wellsprings of  [antimatter](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/1940897862948744641/4854779289886346916#). Sustainable power source through changing over daylight into power—either by utilizing sun oriented cells and concentrating sun powered force or in a roundabout way through biofuel, wind, and hydroelectric force. There is no known route for human progress to utilize what could be compared to the Earth's all-out consumed sun oriented vitality without totally covering the surface with human-made structures, which isn't achievable with current innovation. In any case, if progress developed extremely enormous space-based sun based force satellites, Type I power levels may get attainable.

We would also start using natural disasters to our advantage. Tsunamis could be used to produce energy and earthquakes could be potentially used to terraform parts of the world. With us having complete control over our planet's energy sources, we could also control the weather. If the area of the world were suffering through a drought we could disperse rain clouds over it and bring it back to life. Humanity could also say goodbye to global warming as we'd able to bring the atmosphere back to carbon-neutral and control our planet's temperatures. Casualties from natural disasters would also be reduced, as when and where they might happen. And not only that but we'd be able to live on places of the earth we'd never had dreamed of before. Like in the water as well as in climate that used to be unsuitable for us humans.

Yeeeah, living in a type I civilization would be pretty great. But thing being this perfect, we might get a little bored. But what if we took humanity one step further and became type 2 civilization or even type 2. A type 2 civilization means we could harness the energy of the sun and use it not just on earth but throughout our solar system. we could use its power to travel to and terraform mars. Or even a planet like Neptune. And becoming a type 5 civilization means we'd all be practically gods. We could control and manipulate the universe in whichever way we please. There's no telling when we might evolve to these levels of civilization, but experts generally agree that humanity might be able to reach type 1 in the next 100 years or so. But that's only assuming that humanity lives long enough in the first place. With global warming getting worse and worse, and humanity not taking the correct measure to stop it fast enough there is no telling what would happen.
