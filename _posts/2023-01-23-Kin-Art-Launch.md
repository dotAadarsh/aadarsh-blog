In a groundbreaking move, [Kin.art](https://kin.art/) has disrupted the art world by introducing the world's first AI-safe portfolio platform for artists. This revolutionary solution ensures that artists have control over their work, safeguarding it from unauthorized AI training before it even becomes part of any AI dataset.

Unlike existing solutions that attempt to remedy the situation after the fact, Kin.art takes a proactive stance, preventing artists' work from being included in AI datasets from the outset. Any artist utilizing Kin.art as their portfolio management tool will automatically benefit from its cutting-edge AI protection features starting today.

Flor Ronsmans De Vry, CTO of Kin.art and the driving force behind the platform's development, emphasizes Kin.art as the **first line of defense for artists' creations**. Unlike tools like Nightshade and Glaze, which aim to mitigate damage after inclusion in a dataset, Kin.art stops unauthorized AI training before it commences.

The AI protection solution devised by Ronsmans De Vry adopts a novel approach. Recognizing that AI datasets rely on image-label pairs for effective training, Kin.art disrupts either the image or the associated label, preventing successful insertion into the dataset. This dual disruption method employs image segmentation to ensure complete artwork remains outside AI datasets and label fuzzing to avoid appropriate labels being linked to each image.

Kin.art's commitment to shielding artists is underlined by its founders: CEO Mai Akiyoshi, former VP of Marketing at Logbar and senior engineer at Gusto; CTO Flor Ronsmans De Vry, former co-founder of Fuse Robotics; and COO Ben Yu, former co-founder of Stream and a Thiel Fellowship recipient.
