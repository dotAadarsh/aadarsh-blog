The term 'Bionics' is the study of the mechanical systems which function like living organisms or parts. In which the prefix ‘bio’ - meaning life - with the ‘nics’ of electronics. [Jack E. Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_E._Steele) coined the term 'Bionics' in August 1958.

The expression "biomimetic" is favored when the reference is made to substance reactions. In that space, biomimetic science alludes to responses that, in nature, include organic macromolecules (for example proteins or nucleic acids) whose science can be duplicated in vitro utilizing a lot of littler particles. But let's keep that for another.

Artificial neurons, Artificial neural networks, and swarm intelligence are some of the studies of bionics in the field of computer science. "**At present, there is only a 12% overlap between biology and technology in terms of the mechanisms used**" is estimated by  [Julian Vincent](https://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/teachers/julian-vincent), professor of biomimetics at the University of Bath's Department of Mechanical Engineering.

  
There are commonly three natural levels in the fauna or fauna, after which innovation can be demonstrated:

-   Impersonating characteristic strategies for produce.
-   Impersonating components found in nature ([velcro](https://www.velcro.com/)).
-   Examining authoritative standards from the social conduct of life forms, for example, the rushing conduct of flying creatures, improvement of subterranean insect scavenging and honey bee rummaging, and the swarm intelligence (SI)- based conduct of a school of fish.

Biomechatronics, Biomimetics, Bionic architecture, Biophysics, Cyborgs, and more topics that are related to bionics. So stay tuned to know more!!!
