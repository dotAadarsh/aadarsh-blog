### Introduction

Python is not a snake üêç but a powerful programming language designed by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) which was first released three decades before [ \[‚Üó\]](https://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/brief-timeline-of-python.html). 

Did you know? The name `python` is named after the show called ‚Äú[Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus)‚Äù.

### What makes Python special?

-   **Easy to learn**  - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster.
-  **Easy to teach**  - the teaching workload is smaller than that needed by other languages; this means that the teacher can put more emphasis on general (language-independent) programming techniques, not wasting energy on exotic tricks, strange exceptions, and incomprehensible rules.
-   **Easy to use** for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python.
-   **Easy to understand**  - it's also often easier to understand someone else's code faster if it is written in Python.
-   **Easy to obtain, install and deploy**  - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.

### Of course, Python has its drawbacks, too!

- **Performance** - it's not a speed demon - it does not deliver exceptional performance.
- **Lack of static typing**: Python is *dynamically typed*, which means that you don't need to specify the types of variables when you declare them. This can make the code easier to write and read, but it can also make it harder to catch certain types of errors at runtime.
- **Reliance on third-party libraries**: While Python has a large standard library, there are many tasks that require the use of third-party libraries. This can be a disadvantage if you need to use a library that is not well-maintained or has a limited feature set.
- In some cases it may be resistant to some simpler testing techniques - this may mean that debugging Python's code can be more difficult than with other languages; fortunately, making mistakes is always harder in Python.

### Stats from [2022 Developer Survey \[Stack Overflow\]](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/)

- When it comes to programming Python ranks third (58.38%) among the most popular languages for those who are learning to code, with little difference in popularity between them. 
- Looking at frameworks and libraries, Among those learning to code, a higher percentage use NumPy (43%) and Pandas (35%) compared to professional developers (24% and 22%, respectively). This is likely because both NumPy and Pandas are based on Python, which is a popular language for those learning to code. In addition, a higher percentage of those learning to code use, TensorFlow (18%) and Scikit-learn (17%), compared to professional developers (11% for both).
- Developers choose Rust (17.6%) which closely ties with Python (17.59%) as the most wanted technology.

### Hello, World!

One of the first things that many people learn when they start learning a new programming language is how to print "Hello, World!" to the console. This simple task serves as a basic introduction to the syntax and structure of the language, and it is a common way for people to get started with coding. Let's print it out!
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
In Python, printing "Hello, World!" to the console is very easy. All you need to do is use the **print()** function and pass it the string that you want to print.
