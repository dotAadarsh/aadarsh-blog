We are in the huge development of the technologies. But what about the architecture? What is the improvement in it? What's the recent research going on in architecture? So here is the topic called camouflage architecture.

Camouflage describes a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty. The conversation inside the architectural Place–character hypothesis has taken a move. With conventional structures of the character holding less incentive to society, and symbolism getting increasingly predominant, new models of place–character are important. This is compared with a diminishing Nationalist viewpoint and an expanding investigation of the Post–Modern.

Furthermore, this idea includes been spread inside the urban setting since the First World War as an astute arrangement with the space to accomplish the most extreme advantage with minimal measure of misfortune. So the analyst put speculation that nowadays different parts of disguise can be utilized to tackle the abnormal issues in the urban domain yet there is no genuine rule seemed to plan the proficient cover building. Although more work has been done on the alleged versatile designs which can respond reversibly to their environmental factors reacting to sustainable development as; ecological, social, or economical, such structures represent a significant period contingent upon their inactive and dynamic segments, and they could be identified with the idea of cover. So the examination plans to proclaim the nearness of disguise perspectives inside their different shapes in architecture, especially those alluding to a few examples and responding to the proficiency issue, to give a rule for designing efficient camouflaged buildings.

The different applications are done in design as of late to satisfy the states of disguise concerning the examples of dazzling and Mimicryas they satisfy the well-known parts of planning covered in design.

Below are some of the ways to achieve camouflage architecture.

-   Direct painting on the surface.
-   Painting on the intelligent screens.
-   Pixeled Digital camouflage patterns.
-   Using the dynamic motion in the claddings.
-   Using the static motion in the surfacing screens.
-   The shapes of camouflage within Mimicry.
-   Using false identical patterns.

The fundamental ideas of camouflage in structures; as taking out shape and volume plays inside hypotheses of visual identification or suppositions of diminishing structure permeability as methods for stunning or mimicry (pixel ling) and the two rely upon shading inside the example or utilizing components for setup inside examples yet with worry to the insight which changed over the methods for disguise into a multifunctional implies so the camouflage pattern gives off an impression of being of the twofold face in any event as visual covering just as the disguise from the natural atmosphere.

The three pole of camouflage in buildings:
- Environment sustainability
- Visual innovation
- Economical sustainability
