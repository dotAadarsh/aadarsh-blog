Hi, I’m Aadarsh — a Mechatronics graduate turned aspiring Marketing Associate with a passion for storytelling, strategy, and human connection.

My journey started in the world of machines and logic, where I learned how to solve complex problems and think systematically. But somewhere between circuit diagrams and Python scripts, I landed in Marketing.

Today, I’m building my career at the intersection of creativity and analytics. Whether it’s crafting content, analyzing user behavior, or shaping brand narratives, I’m driven by the idea of making things that resonate.

Beyond work, I find inspiration in cinema and music. I treat films like case studies in emotion and storytelling, and I believe a great song and a great campaign both hit when they’re honest, clear, and unforgettable.

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, or just geeking out over a film soundtrack.

To be honest, I didn't write the above. I simply asked ChatGPT to write it out. I just keep on exploaring diffrent stuff. Anyway, if you've made it this far, let's connect :)

Have a great day!
